If you are like me, that is, you would have searched the web, but you would have been confronted with cognitive overload, and you are just looking for a step-by-step guide that will take you from point A (*downloading git*) right up to managing your own remote repository, then you have visited the right place, and I would encourage you to continue reading. 

It is important to note that this guide does not contain all of the git commands but instead the commonly used ones that would enable you to get your hands dirty and your mind on the right track.
